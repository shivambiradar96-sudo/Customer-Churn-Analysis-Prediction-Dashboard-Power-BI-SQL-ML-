# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Prediction-Dashboard-Power-BI-SQL-ML-
Built a Customer Churn Analysis project using Power BI, SQL, and Python. Cleaned and analyzed customer data, identified key churn factors, and created an interactive dashboard with KPIs. Used a simple ML model to predict high-risk customers and provide insights to improve retention.

Project Target

Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:

Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels
Demographic
Geographic
Payment & Account Info
Services
Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners
 

Metrics Required

Total Customers
Total Churn & Churn Rate
New Joiners

#Creating Database

Create View for Power BI

Create View vw_ChurnData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status In ('Churned', 'Stayed')
  

Create View vw_JoinData as
    select * from prod_Churn where Customer_Status = 'Joined'


STEP 2 – Power BI Transform

Add a new column in prod_Churn

1.       Churn Status = if [Customer_Status] = “Churned” then 1 else 0

2.       Change Churn Status data type to numbers

3.       Monthly Charge Range = if [Monthly_Charge] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 50 then “20-50” else if [Monthly_Charge] < 100 then “50-100” else “> 100”

 

Create a New Table Reference for mapping_AgeGrp

1.       Keep only Age column and remove duplicates

2.       Age Group = if [Age] < 20 then “< 20” else if [Age] < 36 then “20 – 35” else if [Age] < 51 then “36 – 50” else “> 50”

3.       AgeGrpSorting = if [Age Group] = “< 20” then 1 else if [Age Group] = “20 – 35” then 2 else if [Age Group] = “36 – 50” then 3 else 4

4.       Change data type of AgeGrpSorting to Numbers

 

Create a new table reference for mapping_TenureGrp

1.       Keep only Tenure_in_Months and remove duplicates

2.       Tenure Group = if [Tenure_in_Months] < 6 then “< 6 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 12 then “6-12 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 18 then “12-18 Months” else if [Tenure_in_Months] < 24 then “18-24 Months” else “>= 24 Months”

3.       TenureGrpSorting = if [Tenure_in_Months] = “< 6 Months” then 1 else if [Tenure_in_Months] =  “6-12 Months” then 2 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = “12-18 Months” then 3 else if [Tenure_in_Months] = “18-24 Months ” then 4 else 5

4.       Change data type of TenureGrpSorting  to Numbers

 

Create a new table reference for prod_Services

1.       Unpivot services columns

2.       Rename Column – Attribute >> Services & Value >> Status

 

STEP 3 – Power BI Measure
Total Customers = Count(prod_Churn[Customer_ID])

New Joiners = CALCULATE(COUNT(prod_Churn[Customer_ID]), prod_Churn[Customer_Status] = “Joined”)

 

Total Churn = SUM(prod_Churn[Churn Status])

Churn Rate = [Total Churn] / [Total Customers]

STEP 5 – Predict Customer Churn
For predicting customer churn, we will be using a widely used Machine Learning algorithm called RANDOM FOREST.
